# Capstone

This is a working directory for my final project at Minerva University. I will be publishing a package which corresponds to this work and this is more of a work-in-progress repository. Please feel free to leave suggestions about the work and the package. The main focus of the package is to support decision making in sports using data science and machine learning. The first sport being tackled is Formula 1 but Football and Basketball will potentially be added in the future. Please leave suggestions or reach out to talk about this project.
